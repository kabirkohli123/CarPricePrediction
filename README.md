## Introduction

Estimating the price of a car based on its features is a valuable tool for buyers, sellers, and automotive companies. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate car prices using various car attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training:** Implements several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses cross-validation and metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate the performance of different models.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualizations to compare model performance and understand feature importance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
